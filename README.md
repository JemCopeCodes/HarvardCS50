# HarvardCS50
Code from working through the [Harvard CS50x2020: Introduction to Computer Science](https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0) course. 

I think it's very useful to compare solutions so you can learn how to code better or see a different way to approach a problem, but make the effort to solve the problems yourself first even if it's frustrating. You'll develop a deeper understanding from this actual practice. Really ultra stuck? Try checking the CS50 notes, rewatching the lecture, or using the CS50 help command.
